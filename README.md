# 2D_SRRN
A novel approach to reactive navigation which tightly couples an analytically derived model and a learned enhancement policy. The sensor modality utilised is a 2D laser scanner and the entire system can be integrated as part of the ROS navigation stack as described below. All policy training is completed in simulation and zero-shot transferred to the real-world.A novel approach to reactive navigation which tightly couples an analytically derived model and a learned enhancement policy. A visual (RGB-D) alternative of this approach will be uploaded soon. A 2D environement for training custom agents is also given which is built upon the gym framework and can seamlessly intergrate with exisiting deep reinforcement learning implementations.
