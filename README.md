# Residual Reactive Navigation: Combining Classical and Learned Navigation Strategies for Deployment in Unknown Environments
A novel approach to reactive navigation which tightly couples an analytically derived model and a learned enhancement policy. The sensor modality utilised is a 2D laser scanner and the entire system can be integrated as part of the ROS navigation stack local planner. All policy training is completed in simulation and zero-shot transferred to the real-world. A 2D environment for training custom agents is also given which is built upon the gym framework and can seamlessly intergrate with exisiting deep reinforcement learning implementations.

Code coming soon!
