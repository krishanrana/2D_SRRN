# Residual Reactive Navigation: Combining Classical and Learned Navigation Strategies for Deployment in Unknown Environments
Code and training environment for accompaning paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10972. A novel approach to reactive navigation which tightly couples an analytically derived model and a learned enhancement policy. The sensor modality utilised is a 2D laser scanner and the entire system can be integrated as part of the ROS navigation stack local planner. All policy training is completed in simulation and zero-shot transferred to the real-world. The 2D environment provided is built upon the gym framework and can seamlessly intergrate with exisiting deep reinforcement learning implementations.
