# Residual Reactive Navigation: Combining Classical and Learned Navigation Strategies for Deployment in Unknown Environments
Code and training environment for accompaning paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10972. A novel approach to reactive navigation which tightly couples an analytically derived model and a learned enhancement policy. The sensor modality utilised is a 2D laser scanner attached to a differential drive mobile robot . All policy training is completed in simulation and zero-shot transferred to the real-world. The environment provided is built upon the gym framework and can seamlessly intergrate with exisiting deep reinforcement learning implementations.
